# S3
Advertised as *infinitely scaling* storage. Used as:
- Backbone (support)
- Integration

## Use Cases
- Backup & Storage
- Disaster Recovery
- Archive
- Hybrid Cloud storage
- App hosting
- Media hosting
- Data lakes & big data analytics
- Software delivery
- Static website

## What it is?

Store objects (files) in buckets (directories).
- Globally unique name
- Defined at the region level
- Naming convention:
    - NO uppercase neither underscore
    - NO an IP
    - Start lowercase/number
    - 3-63 char long

Accesing a object through the **KEY**, full path: `s3://<NameBucket>/<NameFile>`.
- **Values**:
    - Max object size: 5TB
    - If more than 5GB, must use **"multipart upload"**
- **Metadata**
- **Tags**
- **VersionID** (if enabled)

## Security
**User based**:
- *IAM policies*: allowed API calls from IAM console
**Resource Based**:
- *Bucket Policies*: attached to resource, allow/deny requests from other accounts (cross account access)
- Object ACL - finer grain
- Bucket ACL - less common

An IAM principal can acces if:
- User IAM permissions allow it
- Resource policy *ALLOWS* it
- Not explicit *DENY*

**Encryption to** encrypt the objects.


Bucket policy:
```json
{
    "Version": "",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicRead",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*", // Account/User to apply
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject" // set of API (Allow/Deny)
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/*" // buckets/objects
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Use them for encryption, public access (U need to disable security settings) 
or cross account allow.

**Bucket settings**:
- Block public access by default
- Can be set at the account level

## Versioning
Enabled at the **bucket level**. Protect against unintended deletes. Versions
won't be deleted if disable.


## Access Logs
Any request made to S3, from any account.
You need to:
- Enable server access logging
- Create another S3 Bucket to store the logs

## Replication
Characteristics:
- Enable **versioning** in src & dest
- Buckets can be in diff accounts
- Async copy
- Proper IAM permissions to S3

**Cross Region Replication**:
- Compliance
- Low latency 

**Same Region Replication**:
- Log aggregation
- Live replication between prod & dev

## S3 Storage Classes
- **Standard - GP**
    - 99.99 Avail
    - Frequent access
    - Low lat & high throughput
    - 2 concurr facility failures
    - For: Big Data, mobile & game apps, content distro
- **Standard - Infrequent Access**
    - 99.9% Avail
    - Less accesed but quick (cost on retrieval, for all IA)
    - For: Disaster Recov, BackUp
- **Standard One Zone IA**
    - 99.999999999% in a single AZ Durability
    - 99.5% Avail
    - For: secondary backup copies
- **Glacier Instant Retrieval** (Archiving/Backup, $ = $4storage + obj retrieval cost)
    - ms retrieval (great for data accesed quarterly)
    - min storage duration of 90 days
- **Glacier Flexible Retrieval**
    - 3 Flexibilities: Expedited (1-5 mins), Std (3-5 hrs), Bulk (5-12 hrs)(**FREE**)
- **Glacier Deep Archive**
    - Long term storage
    - Std (12 hrs), Bulk (48 hrs)
    - min storage duration of 180 days
    - Not retrieval cost
- **Intelligent Tiering**
    - Fee for monitoring & auto-tiering (small)
    - Move objects between Tiers based on usage
    - Not retrieval charges
    - Tiers:
        - Frequent: default
        - Infrequent: not accesed for 30 days
        - Archive Instant: "" for 90 days
        - Archive: 90 to 700+days

Move the class of a S3 by:
- Manually
- S3 Lifecycle configs

**Durability**: how many times an object may be lost
**Availability**: how readily available is

## S3 Object Lock
**WORM** (Write Once Read Many) model
- Block an obj version *deletion* for a specific time

## Glacier Vault Lock
**WORM**
- Use a *policy* to prevent edits (undeletable)

## S3 Encryption
- **Server-Side**: when uploaded, server is going to encrypt the file
- **Client-Side**

## Snow Family
Devices to migrate data into/out of AWS
- Highly secure
- Portable

**Data Migration**:
- Snowcone
- Snowball Edge
- Snowmobile

**Edge computing**:
- Snowcone
- Snowball Edge


**Snowball Edge**:
- Block storage, S3-compatible
- Physical transport
- Up to PB


**Snowcone**
- Smaller
- Withstand harsh env (dessert)
- Sent offiline, or use  *AWS DataSync*
- U provide battery/cables
- Up to 15 nodes
- Up to 24 TB

**Snowmobile**
- An actuak truck
- EB of transfers (1 EB = 1,000 PB = 1M TBs)
- E/Snowmobile has 100 PB of capacity
- **High security**: temperature controlled, GPS, 24/7 video surveillance
- *Better than Snowball* if you transfer more than 10 PB

**Usage process**:
1. Request device
2. Install the Snowball client/AWS OpsHub (software to use & manage Snow Family) on your servers
3. Connect the snowball to ur servers & copy files using client
4. Ship back
5. Data loaded into a bucket
6. All data in Snowball is wiped

**Edge computing** is processing data while its created on a *edge location* (things generating data but
not connected to the internet or not easy access to compute power). It is for:
- Preprocess data
- ML at the edge
- Transcode media streams

If you go for something long-term, consider 1 & 3 year discount price
